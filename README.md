Objective and Personal Takeaways:

After having completed the Foundations Course in TheOdinProject, I want to keep exploring some of the possibilities of things I can create using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also wanted to see an example of how someone would go about coding a feature from scratch and to see an example of someone's workflow because I sometimes struggle to visualize where to start and how I should actually start coding, even if I may understand how the functionality works.
